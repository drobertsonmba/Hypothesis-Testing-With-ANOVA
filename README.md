# Hypothesis-Testing-With-ANOVA


Analysis of variance (aka, ANOVA) is a group of statistical techniques that tests the difference in means among three or more groups. This project uses a one-way ANOVA, then a post hoc ANOVA test to determine whether sales are significantly different among various promotional vehicles and levels.


In this project, I work with historical marketing promotion data. I run a one-way ANOVA, then a post hoc ANOVA test to compare whether there is a significant difference between each pair of categories for TV spending.
In my dataset, each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion, where my business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales. I had previously provided insights about how different promotion types affect sales; now stakeholders want to know if sales are significantly different among various TV and influencer promotion levels.


To address this request, I use a one-way ANOVA test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in sales among groups. This includes:
•	Using plots and descriptive statistics to select a categorical independent variable
•	Creating and fitting a linear regression model with the selected categorical independent variable
•	Checking model assumptions
•	Performing and interpreting a one-way ANOVA test
•	Comparing pairs of groups using an ANOVA post hoc test
•	Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to nontechnical stakeholders
